    <h1>The Cheetah</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal,
        estimated to be capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest reliably recorded speeds
        being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61 mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build,
        long thin legs and a long tail. It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body
        length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb).
        Its head is small, rounded, and has a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically
        tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies
        are recognised.</p>

    <p>The cheetah lives in three main social groups, females and their cubs, male "coalitions" and solitary males.
        While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges, males are more sedentary and may
        instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. The cheetah is
        active mainly during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. It feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly
        weighing under 40 kg (88 lb), and prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and Thomson's
        gazelles. The cheetah typically stalks its prey to within 60–70 m (200–230 ft), charges towards it, trips it
        during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout the year. After a gestation
        of nearly three months, a litter of typically three or four cubs is born. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to
        predation by other large carnivores such as hyenas and lions. They are weaned at around four months and are
        independent by around 20 months of age.

    </p>

    <p>The cheetah occurs in a variety of habitats such as savannahs in the Serengeti, arid mountain ranges in the
        Sahara and hilly desert terrain in Iran. The cheetah is threatened by several factors such as habitat loss,
        conflict with humans, poaching and high susceptibility to diseases. Historically ranging throughout most of
        Sub-Saharan Africa and extending eastward into the Middle East and to central India, the cheetah is now
        distributed mainly in small, fragmented populations in central Iran and southern, eastern and northwestern
        Africa. In 2016, the global cheetah population was estimated at around 7,100 individuals in the wild; it is
        listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In the past, cheetahs were tamed and trained for hunting ungulates.
        They have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.

    <h2>Ecology & Behavior</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Cheetahs are active mainly during the day,[67] whereas other carnivores such as leopards and lions are active
        mainly at night;[63][98] These larger carnivores can kill cheetahs and steal their kills;[59] hence, the diurnal
        tendency of cheetahs helps them avoid larger predators in areas where they are sympatric, such as the Okavango
        Delta. In areas where the cheetah is the major predator (such as farmlands in Botswana and Namibia), activity
        tends to increase at night. This may also happen in highly arid regions such as the Sahara, where daytime
        temperatures can reach 43 °C (109 °F). The lunar cycle can also influence the cheetah's routine—activity might
        increase on moonlit nights as prey can be sighted easily, though this comes with the danger of encountering
        larger predators.[59][102] Hunting is the major activity throughout the day, with peaks during dawn and
        dusk.[65] Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk. Cheetahs often inspect their vicinity at observation
        points such as elevations to check for prey or larger carnivores; even while resting, they take turns at keeping
        a lookout.[59]

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>External Anatomy</h3>
    <p>
        The cheetah is a lightly built, spotted cat characterised by a small rounded head, a short snout, black
        tear-like facial streaks, a deep chest, long thin legs and a long tail. Its slender, canine-like form is highly
        adapted for speed, and contrasts sharply with the robust build of the genus Panthera.[11][60] Cheetahs typically
        reach 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4
        ft 11 in).[9][61][62] The weight can vary with age, health, location, sex and subspecies; adults typically range
        between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). Cubs born in the wild weigh 150–300 g (5.3–10.6 oz) at birth, while those
        born in captivity tend to be larger and weigh around 500 g (18 oz).[11][59][61] Cheetahs are sexually dimorphic,
        with males larger and heavier than females, but not to the extent seen in other large cats.[62][63][64] Studies
        differ significantly on morphological variations among the subspecies.[64]
    </p>

    <h3>Speed & Acceleration</h3>
    <p>The cheetah is the fastest land animal.[87][88][89][90][91] Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80
        to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph).[59][62] A commonly quoted value is 112 km/h (70 mph), recorded in 1957, but this
        measurement is disputed.[92] In 2012, an 11-year-old cheetah (named Sarah) from the Cincinnati Zoo set a world
        record by running 100 m (330 ft) in 5.95 seconds over a set run, recording a maximum speed of 98 km/h (61
        mph).[93]
